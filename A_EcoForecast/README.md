Make sure that you have the R package dplyr installed and have also downloaded the G21_GSA_workshop repository. Also look over
some of the forecasting code, especially the `hands_on_activity.Rmd` which is in the `A_EcoForecast/` folder. 

1) To install dplyr, run the command `install.packages('dplyr')`

2) To download the G21_GSA_workshop repository, navigate to `https://github.com/gsagleon/G21_GSA_workshop` and click `Clone or download` => Download ZIP. After the repository has downloaded, unzip it and open the `G21_GSA_workshop.Rproj` file, which should open the project in R. Alternatively, you could fork the repository to your own github account and clone the repository to your desktop.
