Make sure that you have R installed as well as the R package `dplyr`. Please also downloaded the G21_GSA_workshop repository and look over some of the forecasting code, especially the `hands_on_activity.Rmd` which is in the `A_EcoForecast/` folder. If you don't plan on bringing a laptop to GLEON, no worries, you can share with a neighbor! 

1) Download and install `R` from here: https://www.r-project.org/  We also recommend downloading and installing `Rstudio` from here: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download  Please do this prior to the workshop if you plan on bringing a laptop. 

2) To install dplyr, run the command `install.packages('dplyr')`

3) To download the G21_GSA_workshop repository, navigate to `https://github.com/gsagleon/G21_GSA_workshop` and click `Clone or download` => `Download ZIP`. After the repository has downloaded, unzip it and open the `G21_GSA_workshop.Rproj` file, which should open the project in R. Navigate to the forecasting workshop folder in `A_EcoForecast` and check out some of the code and the hands-on activity. Alternatively, you could fork the repository to your own github account and clone the repository to your desktop if you're comfortable doing so.
