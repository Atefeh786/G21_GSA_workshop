# 03 Special Plotting 
# So that was the most simple version of plotting and will get you started
# This will take you the rest of the way to publication ready plotting
# And data exploration

# Load Libraries ----
# this is done each time you run a script
library(readxl) # read in excel files
library(tidyverse) # dplyr and piping and ggplot etc
library(lubridate) # dates and times
library(scales) # scales on ggplot ases
library(skimr) # quick summary stats
library(janitor) # clean up excel imports
library(patchwork) # multipanel graphs

# Statistical Plots ----- 
# Long plot file is the best way to work with data
south_long.df <- read_csv("data/south_lake_long.csv")

# Now lets look at some statistical plot
# try adding in geom_boxplot()
# be careful where you add it
plot1.plot <- ggplot(south_long.df, aes(date, org_l, color=group)) + 
  geom_point() 
plot1.plot

install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)

ggplotly(plot1.plot)






# to fix overlying points
ggplot(south_long.df, aes(group, org_l, color=group)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(size = 3)
  
  
  geom_point(position= position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.3))


# Histograms------
# look for other geoms 
# example of histogram one group at a time
south_long.df %>%
  filter(group=="cladoceran") %>%
  ggplot( aes(org_l, fille=group)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) 

# Area plots -----
south_long.df %>%
  filter(group=="cladoceran") %>%
  ggplot( aes(org_l, fill=group)) + 
  geom_area(stat="bin")

# look at the ggplot cheat sheet and there are many many more graphs 



# lets read in a new file to add some complexity for fun
lakes.df <- read_csv("data/reduced_lake_long_genus_species.csv")


# Special mean and standard error plotting-----
# GGplot has a lot of aspects that make it super fast.
