# 03 Special Plotting 
# So that was the most simple version of plotting and will get you started
# This will take you the rest of the way to publication ready plotting
# And data exploration

# Load Libraries ----
# this is done each time you run a script
library("readxl") # read in excel files
library("tidyverse") # dplyr and piping and ggplot etc
library("lubridate") # dates and times
library("scales") # scales on ggplot ases
library("skimr") # quick summary stats
library("janitor") # clean up excel imports
library("patchwork") # multipanel graphs


# lets read in a new file to add some complexity for fun
lakes.df <- read_csv("data/reduced_lake_long_genus_species.csv")


# Special mean and standard error plotting-----
# GGplot has a lot of aspects that make it super fast.
