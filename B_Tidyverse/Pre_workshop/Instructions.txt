Description of what is needed to do pre-workshop

This is in progress but includes the things we need to be sure are done before
the workshop:
Install R
Install R Studio
Run the file install_packages.R


If you want R and R studio installed on your own laptop please do this before
coming to the meeting. If you have issues contact wlperry@ilstu.edu or see me 
the night before the workshop. Otherwise we will work on an inline version of
R Studio.

R can be obtianed for your system from the following site:
https://cran.r-project.org/

R is the base program sort of like a cell phone we will add apps to


R Studio can be obtained from:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

R Studio is an addon face to R that alloes you to see scripts, figures,
and data you have in memory. It is sort of like the screen on your cell phone
with all the icons.

These two programs alone can do almost all you need to but we add fuctionality
to each program by installing packages one time that installs one or 
many libraries. Once istalled, you load the libraries each time you start R and
run a script.

Please run the install_package.R file in this directory to get the libraries 
installed before coming to the workshop. Again sometimes there are issues
and you are welcome to ask any questions you want to wlperry@ilstu.edu
