This workshop is intended for all skill levels. No lake modeling experience required. Knowledge of R is helpful. While not required, it will be advantageous to bring a laptop with the following installed:

1) R
2) RStudio
3) the R-Packages:
	a) GLM3r
	b) glmtools

You can install these packages with the following R commands:
```
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("GLEON/GLM3r")
devtools::install_github('hdugan/glmtools')
```

GLM3r will allow you to run GLM v.3.0.5 and glmtools is an experimental version of the USGS-R/glmtools with new features (upgraded visualization and added calibration features).

For the workshop, create a working directory with the example R-Script (Code/GLEON21_GLM.R) and all data (Data). This directory should look like this:

```
/bcs
GLEON21_GLM.R
glm3.nml
glm4.nml
```
